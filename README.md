## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I got a really good lesson on hsl() and where I can and can't use alpha values. I also learned that a:visited can't take a color with an alpha value.

I learned about :focus states and hope I used that appropriately in this solution.

I'm trying to improve my use of semantic HTML with every challenge so with this one I styled the cards as <article> elements and nested those within a <section>. I also put the Frontend Mentor attribution in a <footer>. UPDATE: W3 Nu Html Checker said if I'm going to use <section> then it needs a heading, and if it doesn't need a heading then to use a <div>. I'll do that for the next challenge. 

### Continued development

I'll continue to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
